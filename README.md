# Subl-Patch
This Powershell script "activates" Sublime Text, my implementation is likely shit and slow but works.
Tested with build sublime text 4169 in Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 but should work on any Windows with Powershell 5.1.

I have been using this for few months and never had any issue, if something breaks please tell me.
